On the student page in the top right corner where student numbers are listed: could we change "absent" to "unexcused" and put it directly below the excused absences?

I think we could remove the "Short" section on the student page, and list the
number in the attended section as "2 (1)" meaning they were here 2 days but 1
day was short.
